:::important Hello, welcome to our website!

We are a group of players who love modern battleships. We were inspired by the modern battleship FQA provided by Gaijin and produced the earliest version of the Chinese document (FQA without Chinese)

From this basis, we began to expand the website from the Chinese-only version of FQA to include a lot of interesting content about modern warships and memorable things, and prepare to record MWT

We don't have any profit-making activities, just the love for the game!

We want to enrich the content of the website, and sincerely hope that players who love the game will join us, so that our subsequent content updates will be more complete and accurate, and help more new and old players understand the game and fall in love with it!

Thank you so much!
